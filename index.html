Arc and Ciara cannot agree on who should compete for the annual Roxbury Cup on behalf of the Phoenix Squad. After Arc finally gets nominated through a coin flip, Ciara nominates herself at the last minute. Arc tries to make Ciara quit by inviting the Princess; however, since quitting the competition would get Ciara kicked out of knight school, Arc and Ciara must figure out how to make it look like the Princess is there while Ciara is competing. When the King demands to speak to the Princess, Ciara must leave mid-competition to save Arc, which means that Sage later manages to win the cup for the Kraken Squad.
Guest stars: Jason Sims-Prewitt, Seth Carr
It is Armor Day in Astoria and Phoenix Squad is hosting the festivities in knight school. To avoid anyone suspecting that Arc is not from Astoria, Ciara teaches him all the Armor Day traditions; however, when Arc messes up by hiding the symbolic chocolate armor in the wrong place, Ciara and Arc must battle an angry pack rat to get the armor back in time.

Sorceress Spitzalot (Mary Passeri) from the sorcery school comes to test any knight school students that may have magical powers so that she can transfer them to her magic school. Warwick tells Arc that he failed the magic spell test on purpose because if anyone found out that he had magical powers, he would be kicked out of school. However, his powers are exposed when he accidentally brings a villain to life from a painting. Prudy, who had been convinced by Sage to quit knight school, returns to help Ciara save the day. The Princess convinces the King to change the rules to let magical students like Warwick remain in knight school.
Guest stars: Jason Sims-Prewitt, Mary Passeri
Jimbo (Tenzing Norgay Trainor), a former member of Phoenix Squad, returns to knight school after being trapped in a cave for months. He takes back his position, forcing Arc out.

After making a retreat to Astoria, Ciara doubts that she can help defeat Ryker after seeing Eliza on her side and discards her pixie ring. When Ryker attacks, he takes control of Hogancross, Sir Gareth, and the rest of the knights using the Mark of Ryker spell. The Princess notices the Mark of Ryker on Eliza's hand as the King provides the Princess and Arc with a distraction to get away. Meanwhile, Fizzwick persuades Prudence, Warwick, Sage, and Buttercup to work together to find a spell to defeat the Armor of Astoria. After some persuasion from Arc, the Princess becomes Ciara again and fights Eliza. The rest of the students show up with weapons enchanted by a spell-removal enchantment casted by Warwick as they free Eliza, Hogancross, Sir Gareth, and the other knights from the Mark of Ryker.

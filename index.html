After making a retreat to Astoria, Ciara doubts that she can help defeat Ryker after seeing Eliza on her side and discards her pixie ring. When Ryker attacks, he takes control of Hogancross, Sir Gareth, and the rest of the knights using the Mark of Ryker spell. The Princess notices the Mark of Ryker on Eliza's hand as the King provides the Princess and Arc with a distraction to get away. Meanwhile, Fizzwick persuades Prudence, Warwick, Sage, and Buttercup to work together to find a spell to defeat the Armor of Astoria. After some persuasion from Arc, the Princess becomes Ciara again and fights Eliza. The rest of the students show up with weapons enchanted by a spell-removal enchantment casted by Warwick as they free Eliza, Hogancross, Sir Gareth, and the other knights from the Mark of Ryker. After Arc knocks Ryker to the ground, the others remove the spell from the Armor of Astoria as Hogancross teleports Ryker away. After the King is freed from the dungeon, Sir Gareth thanks his students and gives them a day off....which isn't really going to give them as there are other threats to Astoria out there. In the final scene, Prudence finds the secret passage to the Princess' bedroom and runs into Ciara there.
A wounded Princess Eliza returns to Astoria to inform her father that Ryker is after the Armor of Astoria. As Hogancross and Sir Gareth want the students to find a way to disable the Armor of Astoria before it can be used by Ryker to cross the forcefield protecting Astoria. While Ciara and Arc go on a secret quest to get the Armor of Astoria before Ryker's forces can find it, Prudence and Warwick compete against Sage and Buttercup with comical results.
